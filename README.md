I have successfully built and am using the 28C256 EEPROM programmer designed by Colin M (crmaykish) for my retro computer project.

Here is the original project https://github.com/crmaykish/AT28C-EEPROM-Programmer-Arduino

I have modified the original Python code by adding a graphical user interface (GUI) and some useful features, such as a HEX dump screen when reading the EEPROM contents.

I have also created a Windows executable version, which requires Python to be installed on Windows.

Need to install Pyserial lib. 

pip install pyserial
